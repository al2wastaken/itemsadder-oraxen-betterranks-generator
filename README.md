# ✨ ItemsAdder/Oraxen Custom Font Tag Generator / API

Made with Python and love by al2 ❤️

## Needs
- python 3.x, anything works if it's LTS.
- And if you host it as an API, a virtual machine. https://oyunlayici.com/ for Minecraft hosting and Websites.

### Modules
For basic: PIL, Image, ImageDraw, colorsys and io.
For API: flask and the basic modules.
Simply use "pip install <module name>"

## How To Use It?
So, basicly install the modules and start the app.py you need and search up on your browser for "http://127.0.0.1:5000/generate-image?text=<your rank, ex: owner, admin, developer, vip>&color=%23<hex code with out hashtag, ex: ffaaff>&darker_color=%23<hex code with out hashtag, ex: ff55ff>" or just run basic.py and enter your things and start to create custom font tags!

### Notes before use it:
- You can use " instead of plus sign to request it, normal plus sign can not work on API.
- You can use 0 for darker color input for automaticly darken the color.
- Use "%23" instead of "#" before hex code, it will be cause an error.
- If you want to add extra png you can use [Aseprite](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite) and don't forget to make blank on top, it's important.
- Web API doesn't save anything you need to save as picture on your browser.
- Enjoy using it :)
